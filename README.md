<p>Hi Ben, it was fun creating this.  I made two links instead of one, the first link shows all the train info, and the user can type in and filter out the desired station.  While the second one, the user just typed in the train station code, and it would display all train schedules in that station.  When I lived in New York, I can never remember the train code, so I thought the first one would be a better way for the user to search.

<p>Also hope you don't mind, but I had my dog help me to debug... he wasn't a lot of help.
